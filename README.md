# Crocengine
## An Automated AI based Complience Platform


## Overview

Every year, crypto companies face **millions in fines** due to non-compliance with global **KYC (Know Your Customer)** and **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)** regulations. Traditional compliance systems rely on **centralized databases**, leading to:

* **User data risks** (e.g., Binance data leak exposing millions of records).
* **Manual & inefficient processes** causing delays, errors, and higher costs.
* **Regulatory uncertainty**, as rules keep changing across countries.

**CrocEngine** solves this by using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to encode compliance into cryptographic attestations—ensuring **privacy-first, simplified, and verifiable compliance**.

## Our Solution

CrocEngine enables:

* **Master & Attribute ZK Proofs** – Encodes KYC/AML checks into cryptographic attributes and merges them into a master proof.
* **Privacy-First** – No sensitive user data is exposed; regulators only verify compliance proofs.
* **Convenience** – Easy to integrate into **exchanges, wallets, and dApps** via SDKs & APIs.
* **One-Stop Compliance** – Institutions can meet multiple global regulatory requirements with a single verification.
